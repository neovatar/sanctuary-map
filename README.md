# Map of the City of Sanctuary (Thieves' World)

This is a map of the city of Sanctuary that I made made with Wonderdraft and hand-drawn assets. Sanctuary is a City in the shared world nocel setting of [Thieves' World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thieves%27_World) created by by Robert Lynn Asprin in 1978.
